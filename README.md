[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BTOdell/GHSC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/BTOdell/GHSC)

## Overview

**GHSC** is an ever-growing communication program which allows multiple individuals 
to talk over any local network (such as a home network).<br/>
It is written in the **Java programming language**.<br/>
The source code consists of over **13,000 lines of code**.

## Features

1. User-friendly interactive GUI (graphical user interface).
2. Saves settings in a user profile.
3. Independent chat rooms called "channels". Functions similar to IRC (Internet relay chat).
4. Spam control.
5. Automatic application updating.

## Future Features

1. File sharing
2. Improve network security by using public key encryption and SSL sockets instead of 
   a hardcoded AES secret key (*yikes!*)
3. Private messaging (messaging outside of channels)
4. Image and link integration into chat area
5. Screen sharing
